# Surfaces and orientations

*The material for ESRF Users Meeting, Volume Image Analysis Tutorial by Vedrana Andersen Dahl, QIM, February 2023.*


## LECTURES
- Intro to QIM, intro to 3DIM  (lecture, Anders) [Link to presentation.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHWZaNWdymsDziM6Cq3cbRm7Oqo6qd6H/view)
  Take-home message: Micro-CT allows imaging the microstructure of tissues and materials in 3D. However, analyzing volumetric CT data may be challenging. QIM supports.

- Surfaces and orientations (lecture, Vedrana) [Link to presentation.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115D8DAnExdRdPLwEFTq9gLhr-5adgAwp/view?usp=sharing)
  Take-home message: If your 3D problem can be formulated as surface detection, you may reduce the complexity of your problem. If your analysis of fibrous material can be done without segmenting fibres, the stability of your approach can be improved.



## EXERCISES

All notebooks (and other notebooks) may be found on the github repository https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks). If you have some experience with programming, you can clone or download the repository and run the notebooks from your machine. For some of the notebooks, you will probaby need to make small modifications. For example, mounting google drive will need modification, and you will need to installing all python modules the code uses. You are encouraged to try the code on your own data.

If you have no experience in programming, the easiest (less steep learning curbe) is to run the notebooks from google colab. You will only need a google account to run the notebooks. However, when only running the notebooks, the learning might be smaller. Try to make some modifications, or run the code on other images.
