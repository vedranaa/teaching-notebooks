# teaching-notebooks
*Collection of notebooks used for teaching various courses.*


At this site, I will be sharing the collections of notebooks I use in teaching. The notebooks are used in DTU courses and other events.

All notebooks are collected in thisgithub repository [https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks). If you have experience with programming in Python, you can clone or download the repository and run the notebooks from your machine.
