*The material prepared for DTU Course 02509, High-Performance Computing for Analysis of Experimental 3D Imaging Data, by Vedrana A Dahl, March 2023.*

# Week 6: Porosity

Relevant topics which will be covered in the lectures:
- Materials and tissues: porous, fibrous and laminar.
- Analysis requiring a precise segmentation, analysis robust to segmentation quality, and segmentation-free analysis.
- Loading data: bytes, bites, bit depth, bit ratio, downsampling (important for data downloaded from qim repository, e.g. hourglas data).
- Segmentation pipeline: the use of gaussian filtering, median filtering and moprhological oparations for segmentation.
- Unmixing volume histogram.
- Distance transform, watershed transform.
- Connected component analysis (algorithm), [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling).
- Various statistics to be extracted from connected components.
- Local thickness, [old ImageJ reference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3E846EB8BD1F5B0E2C3295D891A99E11/S1431927607074430a.pdf/computing_local_thickness_of_3d_structures_with_imagej.pdf).
- Statistics to be extracted from local thickness.
- Fitting models to data: lognormal distribution.
- Visualization of results.
- Coding best practice: testing code line for line, degubbing.

Additional material: the [note on porosity](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/vand/notes/porosity_course_note.pdf) (but using matlab), and the paper about local thickness. I can also share [note on visualization using paraview](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/vand/notes/ParaView_notes.pdf).


## Exercise 1, focus: connected component analysis 
Notebooks:
- [02509 hourglass segmentation](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_segmentation.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_segmentation.ipynb).
- [02509 hourglass connected components](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_connected_components.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_connected_components.ipynb).
- To see how the data was preprocessed after being donwloaded from [qim data repository](https://qim.compute.dtu.dk/data-repository/index.html) you can see the preprocessing notebook, [02509_hourglass cropping](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_cropping.ipynb).

## Exercise 2, focus: local thickness
Notebooks:
- [02509 hourglass local thickness](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_local_thickness.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_local_thickness.ipynb).
- You can also check other notebooks in [local thicknes repository](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness), including [examples](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Examples.ipynb) or [demos](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Demos.ipynb). Colab links: [examples](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Examples.ipynb) or [demos](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Demos.ipynb).


## Additional material (fully optional)

The notebook on porosoty analysis is placed in the repository [https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks) where I collect various notebooks used for teaching. You may find other notebooks usefull. If you have experience with programming in Python, you can clone or download the repository and run the notebooks on your machine or on the DTU G-bar cluster. For some of the notebooks, you will probaby need to make small modifications. For example, mounting google drive will require modification, and you will need to install all modules the code uses. You are encouraged to try the code on your own data.

If you have no experience in programming, the easiest (less steep learning curve) is to run the notebooks from google colab.  For this, you only need a google account. For many notebooks I write a direct link which opens the notebook in Colab. If the direct link is not provided, you can open the notebook in Colab by looking at the notebook http address, for example `https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/<notebook_name>.ipynb` and modifying it to 
`https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/<notebook_name>.ipynb`.
