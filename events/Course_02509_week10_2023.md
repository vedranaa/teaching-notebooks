*The material prepared for DTU Course 02509, High-Performance Computing for Analysis of Experimental 3D Imaging Data, by Vedrana A Dahl, April 2023.*

# Week 10: Thickness and orientation

Relevant topics which will be covered in the lectures:
- Layered materials and tissues: layered surface detection.
- Analysing orientation without segmentation.

Additional material: the [note on orientations](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/vand/notes/ST_intro.pdf).


## Exercises


#### Focus: thickness
- [02509 hourglass segmentation](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_segmentation.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_segmentation.ipynb).
- [02509 hourglass connected components](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_connected_components.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_connected_components.ipynb).
- To see how the data was preprocessed after being donwloaded from [qim data repository](https://qim.compute.dtu.dk/data-repository/index.html) you can see the preprocessing notebook, [02509_hourglass cropping](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_cropping.ipynb).

#### Focus: orientation
- [02509 hourglass local thickness](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_local_thickness.ipynb), for easy acces you can also open the notebook in Google colab using this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/02509_hourglass_local_thickness.ipynb).
- You can also check other notebooks in [local thicknes repository](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness), including [examples](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Examples.ipynb) or [demos](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness/blob/main/Demos.ipynb).
