*The material prepared for DTU Course 02509, High-Performance Computing for Analysis of Experimental 3D Imaging Data, by Vedrana A Dahl, April 2023.*

# Week 10: Surfaces and orientations

Relevant topics which will be covered in the lectures:
- Layered materials and tissues: layered surface detection, the algorithm popularized by the article of [Li et al Optimal surface segmentation in volumetric images - A graph-theoretic approach (PAMI 2006)](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/543f7d07acc4e2154d662d47).
- Analysing orientation without segmentation: structure tensor, as covered in the  [Structure tensors note](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/vand/notes/ST_intro.pdf).
- Layered surfaces is also the topic of Chapter 7, while structure tensor the topic of Chapter 17 of the lecture notes for DTU course 02506 which can be downloaded [here](https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02506/).
