# Intro, UNets and IntSegtPy

*The material for Solid assembly, Aarhus 2/3-23, by Vedrana A Dahl and Anders B. Dahl.*



## EXERCISES

**Experts.** All notebooks (and other notebooks) may be found on the github repository [https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks). If you have experience with programming in Python, you can clone or download the repository and run the notebooks from your machine. For some of the notebooks, you will probaby need to make small modifications. For example, mounting google drive will need modification, and you will need to install all modules the code uses. You are encouraged to try the code on your own data.

**Begginers.** If you have no experience in programming, the easiest (less steep learning curve) is to run the notebooks from google colab. For this, you will only need a google account. However, when only running the notebooks, the learning might be more limited. Try to make some modifications, or run the code on other images.
