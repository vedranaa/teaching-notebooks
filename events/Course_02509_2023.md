**Additional material.** 
This repository, [https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks](https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks), contains various notebooks used for teaching. If you have experience with programming in Python, you can clone or download the repository and run the notebooks from your machine or DTU G-bar cluster. For some of the notebooks, you will probaby need to make small modifications. For example, mounting google drive will need modification, and you will need to install all modules the code uses. You are encouraged to try the code on your own data.

If you have no experience in programming, the easiest (less steep learning curve) is to run the notebooks from google colab.  For this, you will only need a google account. For many notebooks I write a direct link for opening it in Colab. If the direct link is not provided, you can open the notebook in colab by looking at the notebook http address, for example `https://github.com/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/<notebook_name>.ipynb` and modifying it to 
`https://colab.research.google.com/github/vedranaa/teaching-notebooks/blob/main/<notebook_name>.ipynb.
